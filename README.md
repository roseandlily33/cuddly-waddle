# Book Search Engine

## Description:
A full stack MERN application, redone with some starter code to use apollo, react, and graphql.

## Usage:
Create an account, or login, then browse the books by typing the name of a book into the search bar, save the book to your account and then you can view all of your saved books and delete a book you not longer want to read that book.

## Install:
Clone the repository to your local computer, open it up in vscode or another text editor, and run npm install, it will download all your dependencies for the client and the server and then run npm run develop to run both the server and the client at the same time.
