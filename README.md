# Book Search Engine

## Description:
A full stack MERN application, redone with some starter code to use apollo, react, and graphql.

## Usage
Create an account, or login, then browse the books by typing the name of a book into the search bar, save the book to your account and then you can view all of your saved books and delete a book you not longer want to read that book.
